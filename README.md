# MOVED SOVND
Interactive experimental installation generating "semi-binaural-beats" using the Kinect - made with Processing.

**IMPORTANT**
The sketch requires a MP4 file, which should be in **/data/the-clip.mp4**
The current clip file is just a sample. Replace **/data/the-clip.mp4** with your own clip.


If you want to take snapshots, change the constant:
```
final String takeSnapshots = true;
```


Set the absolute path where your snapshots should be saved at, by changing the constant:
```
final String savePath = "/path/to/snapshots/directory";
```
